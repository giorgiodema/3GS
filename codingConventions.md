# Coding conventions
Since JavaScript can be one huge mess if not managed properly, we're collecting 
here some conventions we'll be using in our project to favor consistency, performance
and elegance.

## Object oriented programming

### Class declaration

```javascript
class Musician {
    constructor (name, earnings) {
        // Public fields
        this.name = name;
        // Private fields
        this._earnings = earnings;
    }
    // Public methods
    printDiscography () {
        console.log("Many cool records");
    }

    // Private methods
    _printResidence () {
        console.log("You should not call this from outside the class");
    }
}
```

Notes:

- The syntax for private fields and methods will be easily updated to the WIP private [fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields#private-fields)/[methods](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q9upYkWnPjJaVc8k9q3U6NekDch8tsz7CgV-Xm55-5Y/edit#slide=id.g423c483f71_0_39) of JS by just replacing "_" with "#".
- This way of declaring methods only creates one function object in the prototype, which is referenced by all instances. This is good compared to techniques that end up creating a new one per instance.

### Class instantiation

```javascript
let me = new Musician("Jotaro", 0);
inst.printDiscography();
```

### Inheritance

```javascript
class Drummer extends Musician {
    constructor(name, earnings, doubleBass) {
        // Fields of the parent class
        super(name, earnings);

        // Specific fields
        this.doubleBass = doubleBass;
    }
}

let moreSpecificObject = new Drummer ("Mike", 1000, true);
if (moreSpecificObject.doubleBass)
    moreSpecificObject.printDiscography();
```
